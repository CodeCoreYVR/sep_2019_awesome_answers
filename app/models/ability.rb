  # cancancan assumes you have a method called `current_user`
  # available in your ApplicationController (which we do).
  # cancancan gets automatically initialized with
  # current_user passed to the initialize method.
  def initialize(user)
    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
      user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
      if user.is_admin?
        can :manage, :all
      end
    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true

    # Use the alias_action method to assign multiple action
    # names to one action alias. That means the alias can
    # be used in place of any of the supplied actions.
    # In this case :crud can be used whenever :create,
    # :read, :update, :destroy would be used.
    alias_action :create, :read, :update, :destroy, to: :crud


    # To define a permission for a user, use the `can` method
    # inside of this class` intialize method. It takes the
    # following args in order:
    # - The name of the action you are testing permission for
    # as a symbol  (e.g. :create :read, :update, :delete,
    # :like, :crud)
    # - The class of an object that we are testing the action
    # against.
    # - A block that is used to determine whether or not a
    # user can perform that action on the resource. If the
    # block returns true, the user can perform the action
    # otherwise they can't.
    can(:crud, Question) do |question|
      question.user == user
    end

    can :crud, Answer do |answer|

    end
    # Can also write abilities like:
    # can :manage, Question, user_id: user.id
    can(:crud, JobPost) do |job_post|
      job_post.user == user
