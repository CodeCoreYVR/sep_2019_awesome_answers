  # rails g model question title:string body:text
  # This command also generates a migration file
  # in db/migrate

  # Rauls will add attr_accessors for all columns of
  # the database table. (i.e. id, title, body, created_at, updated_at)

  # Create validations by using the 'validates' method
  # The arguments are (in order):
  # - A column name as a symbol
  #  - Named arguments corresponding to the
  # validation rules you want to set.

  validates(:title, presence: true, uniqueness: true)
  # presence refuses any record with the column nil
  # or empty

  # When a validation fails, ActiveRecord will not
  # save the model instance or any changes to the db.
  # You can view validation errors, by calling
  # the .errors method on the object itself.

  # To list them in a human friendly manner:
  # q.errors.full_messages

  # Custom validation
  # Be careful, the method for custom validations is
  # singular, otherwise it's almost exactly the same
  # as for regular validations.

  # that allows us to respond to events during the
  # life of a model instance (i.e. being vaidated, being created, being updated etc.)

  # there's a way to create them quicker.
